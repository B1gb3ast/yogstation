			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Medical has been significantly changed. Read on for more in-depth changes.</li>
				<li class="wip">Casual observers can now more correctly discern the ways in which a person has been wounded. For example, burns from electrical sources are now obvious, as are brute injuries from pressure exposure, so on. In addition, oxygen damage on a target is now apparent past a certain threshold. If someone goes blue, they're in trouble.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The efficency and availability of a lot of existing 'generic' medical items has been reduced significantly. Head to Medbay for proper healing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sleepers can now only be used effectively by medical personnel and the AI.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryogenic pods now use significantly more chemicals per cycle. Their healing rate remains unchanged.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CPR's effectiveness has been reduced dramatically. A dedicated single player using CPR on a critical target will now just barely slow down the oxygen deprivation damage. Epipens remain as effective as before.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New surguries to fix large amounts of brute and burn damage to a limb have been added.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bandage-class medical items have been added to the game and seeded throughout first aid packs. Additionally, improvised bandages may be fashioned from cloth torn from a jumpsuit. Bandages heal brute OR burn damage over time, and can only be applied one at a time per target. They will fall off once their healing is done, and can be washed to be reused again at a lesser potency.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryogenics is now locked only to medical staff. During red alert or above, it will be accessible to all players.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryoxadone effectiveness reduced by 33% on all damage types except clone.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sleepers are now unlocked to all staff during red alert or above.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed miscellaneous bandage issues. They should now fit inside belts and first aid kits.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bandages can now be applied to multiple limbs. They will cease healing damage once their effect has expired or the limb is fully healed - they no longer overheal. They may also be stripped like handcuffs or other items of clothing.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed cryogenics being inaccessible to normal medical staff. Hopefully. I think. For real this time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adjusted healing of patch-class medical items to provide 66% less healing per volume. 50u patch = 20 damage healed.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a long-standing bug with cryogenics where the machine had no innate healing associated with it when out of chemicals.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reintroduced cryogenics unconsciousness.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sleepers now add a report on a person's health to their medical record when placed inside it automatically where appropriate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Phytosian race has been added. A race of plant-like aliens, the Phytosians thrive in well-lit areas and are damaged badly by the dark. They possess a regenerative ability unmatched by any other race, but die extremely quickly in any area of darkness. Their regeneration requires consciousness to be effective.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Lizard pride has reached all new heights as they adopt their formal species name - the Unathi.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Unathi racial modifiers now properly apply at round start.</li>
				<li class="experiment">There is talk of mysterious happenings aboard other stations nearby - of deity-like creatures creating new places of worship aboard vessels. Nanotrasen does not sanction any such activity, and has encouraged all Command staff to be on the lookout for such things.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Damage lines for all types of injury have been made easier to read at a glance.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bleeding is now much more obvious via examine, in both status and severity.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Default Asimov lawset no longer considers non-Human races as Human in the server rules. AI/Cyborg players are no longer obligated to follow Unathi, Phytosian, Preternis, Hulk, Flyperson, Slimeperson or Pod People requests as per their laws, or protect them from harm.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new server rule governing action against non-Human races as an Asimov silicon has been added. Summary: You can not engage in wholesale genocide 4no raisins against non-Human players, but you can freely ignore their orders, even in situations where doing so will get them killed or injured.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Phytosians are now severely weak to extreme cold to prevent extended spacewalking. This also inhibits regeneration during cryogenics.</li>

When activated, it announces Nuclear Operative desire to blow the station with the nuclear device, delays the departure of their shuttle to 20 minutes after roundstart, but gives them 5.6 TC per player on the server and delays Nanotrasen shuttle call to 25 minutes after roundstart. Can only be used during first 5 minutes of the round (until intercept message).</li>

				<li class="experiment">Foam now produces more bang for your buck when mixed. Your foam grenades should be larger now to account for the slowdown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Stabilizing Agent. This chemical will prevent the effects of certain reactions from taking place in  the container it is in, such as Smoke Powder and Flash Powder, allowing you to get the raw forms of the powders for heating up later.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smoke Powder and Flash Powder can now be mixed along with Stabilizing Agent in order to produce a powder version of the effects. You can then heat these powders to 374K to get the effects.</li>

				<li class="experiment">Smoke now transfers reagents to the mob, and applies touch reactions on them. This means smoke can run out of reagents, no more infinite acid smoke. It also only works on mobs, use the new Reagent Foam(tm) for your hellfoam needs. I suggest a CLF3 Fluoroacid Black Powder mix.</li>

Eating too much sugar too quickly can make you temporarily unable to eat any sugary food. The nutritional effect of sugar depends on how hungry you are thus it cannot easily  raise your nutrition level past well fed and is best used when hungry. Lots of sugar can make you a bit jittery at times. Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread viruses,it makes your body's metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive reagents.

				<li class="rscadd">Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use it to your advantage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research is recommended.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react to being called by the number, but 'slimes' is also acceptable; they are able to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly ordered a slime to stop.</li>

				<li class="experiment"><b>Sacrifice Cult - Cult has received a massive overhaul to how it works, focusing more on cult magics and sacrificing unbelievers. The most important changes are:</b></li>
				<li class="tweak">Cult starts off with alot more cultists, 6 cultists below 30 players and 9 above. The HoP can no longer be a round start cultist but is still convertible.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists start off with join, blood, self, and hell. These give the runes for the sacrifice and convert.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Conversions now require three cultists and converts no longer reward words, words must be obtained via sacrifice</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sacrificing players traps their soul in a soul stone, which can then be used on construct shells to implant the souls in them</li>
				<li class="tweak">Constructs shells can be summoned via a new rune (travel, hell, technology)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer convert the sacrifice target, you dozzy sods</li>
				<li class="experiment">Summoning Narsie when she is not an objective leads to !!FUN!!</li>
				<li class="wip">Wrote a system to allow all mob types to be sacrificable - currently only corgis are in the new system</li>
				<li class="experiment">Holy Water will DECONVERT cultists, takes around 35 units and two minutes to succeed</li>
				<li class="experiment">Hitting a mob that contains holy water with a tome will convert that water to unholy water, conversely hitting any container that contains unholy water with a bible as chaplain will 'cleanse' the taint.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Unholy water works like a combination synaptazine and hyperzine, with a twist of branes dimarge and highly toxic to non-cultists</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cargo can order a religious supplies crate - it contains flasks of holy water, candles, bibles, and robes</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cultists have an innate ability to communicate to the cult hive mind (BE AWARE - THIS DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE), cultists can also communicate via the new Commune option on their tomes (the Read Tome option has been shifted under the Notes option)</li>
